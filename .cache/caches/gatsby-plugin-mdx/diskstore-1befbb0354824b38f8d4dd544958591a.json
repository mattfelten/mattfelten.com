With a tiered heirarchy, we need solid patterns for secondary and tertiary navigation systems. Those are things we haven’t really needed in the past so we spent some time figuring out how we can lay out navigation systems.`}</p>\n    <Asset src={navSketches2} alt=\"navigation sketches\" fullWidth mdxType=\"Asset\" />\n    <p>{`Once there were a number of options to sift through, we did competitor research. How are other apps solving this propblem? We did a few group sketching exercises also to get the juices flowing and get some quick group-think on our side.`}</p>\n    <Asset src={competitors} alt=\"competitors\" fullWidth mdxType=\"Asset\" />\n    <Asset src={navSketches} alt=\"navigation sketches\" fullWidth mdxType=\"Asset\" />\n    <h2>{`Details`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Here’s the fun part.

I spent a lot of time focused on layout and structure. Then switch up focus to aesthetics, type and color. Build out a prototype and test it.

Now I could focus on the details. How do dropdown menus work? Where and how does our employee-only functionality appear? Focusing on each one of these questions in a short design spike let us focus on small, specific problems and smooth out the edges of the complete design.`}</p>\n    <Asset src={panelSearch} caption=\"Search\" fullWidth mdxType=\"Asset\" />\n    <Asset src={panelNav} caption=\"Navigation\" fullWidth mdxType=\"Asset\" />\n    <Asset src={panelIcons} caption=\"Icons\" fullWidth mdxType=\"Asset\" />\n    <Asset src={panelWebid} caption=\"WebID\" fullWidth mdxType=\"Asset\" />\n    <h3>{`Launch!`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Even though we were testing this project throughout the design process, once the team was satisfied that we were hitting all our goals, we ran internal tests.

It took about 8 months, start to end, working on it in between other projects. I learned about the true meaning of iteration, designing variations until you can’t think straight anymore.
