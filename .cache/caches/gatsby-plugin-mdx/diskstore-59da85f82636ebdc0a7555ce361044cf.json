I could force that goal since I’d be doing all the front-end development.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After looking through a number of systems, including WordPress, Jekyll continually checked off all the requirements in my lists. Even some I didn’t realize I wanted. It’s a static-site generator so it would be ripping fast. No database queries to worry about here. It has Sass compilation built-in. It can completely be managed through a git repository. It was perfect.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I had never set up a Jekyll site before but it was way easier than I thought it would be. I worked closely with one of our system engineers to get a proper development/staging/production workflow sorted out. I helped the other designers get the site cloned down to their laptops and the dependencies installed so we can all work on the site locally. And then hammered through coding the site as fast as the other designers could design it.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`This project took just under a year from kickoff to website launch. We’ve done a ton of reworking too since then. It was my first time redoing a brand from the inside so it was a tremendous learning experience. I learned that I enjoy leading people through group design exercises. I learned a lot about selling my work. I learned that bringing people into the design process early is never a bad thing.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
