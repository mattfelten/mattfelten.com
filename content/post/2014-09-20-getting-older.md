I turned 28 this year. My mom asked me recently if I feel like I'm getting old. I was also talking with a buddy the other night and he said he felt too old to do something. It's been on my mind, so I want to talk about it. This is what getting older is like for me at 28.

## My Knee Hurts
I don't remember when this started. Six months ago maybe? But all of a sudden my knee will start hurting after a long day. It's not like I'm on my feet all day. I sit behind a desk. I do walk a mile and a half home every day, so maybe that has something to do with it? I know my grandpa has had both his knees replaced. Is that where this is headed?

## Hangovers Are Worse
I feel like I'm a better judge at my alcohol intake. I can pace myself pretty well. It's not a race to the bottom anymore. But if I overdo it, even a little, I'll have a killer hangover all day. It's either no hangover at all, or a really bad one. There's no middle ground.

## Days Are Shorter
Up until a few years ago, I remember having those "OMG, this day will never end" moments. I don't have those anymore. More often than not, I look at the clock and it's 4pm already. I've heard that the reason days seemed to last forever when you were younger was because you've experienced less total time alive so every day was a larger portion of your total. I also know "time flies when you're having fun," and I do like my job, so maybe it's that? Probably a bit of both?

## Lack of Mystery
I used to get excited over things that I didn't understand. That's gone. I think that since I've experienced more now, I generally know how the proverbial sausage is made. Even if I'm surprised, I can usually figure it out.

## People Listen More
I feel like I'm still the same 18 year old kid, just making everything up as I go. Never sure what to do next. Never knowing if I'm doing the right thing. But I feel like people care what I think more. My age adds weight to my opinions I think.

## More Honest With Myself
I've always been afraid of what other people think of me. I think I've been getting over that. I like Dungeons and Dragons. I play Magic the Gathering. I spend more money on clothes than I should. I watch cooking shows on TV but never actually cook anything. I'm a bit of a recluse and don't have a huge "social network." I like doing introverted things in social settings, like reading at a bar. This is just me though. I don't think I'm going to change, so I might as well become happy with it.
