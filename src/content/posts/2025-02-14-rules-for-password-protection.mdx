## Strong passwords are **long**, **random**, and use a mix of **letters**, **numbers**, and **symbols**

- Hackers are **not** trying to guess your password, so a short complex password like `MyP@ssw0rd` is not any better than `MyPassword`
- Hackers **are** getting passwords from data breaches
- Hackers **are** using **brute force** attacks to try every combination of letters, numbers, and symbols
- üîí A strong password is something like `joKzaj-myktin-tygva7`. A 20 character long password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols has 1,390,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible combinations (not kidding) and could take years to crack.

### The only passwords you need to remember are the one for your computer, and your Apple ID password

- I talk about password managers below, but these are the only passwords that it won't be able to remember for you.
- Make these passwords something long that you can remember. My method is to use 3-4 random words that have meaning to me.
- Maybe something like `pizza-Owen-hansolo-1986` or `Zeppelin-Fishing-Quesadilla`

## For everything else

### Let Safari Generate Strong Passwords

- Safari can generate very strong and unique passwords for each website
- You need a unique password for every website. This makes sure that if one website is compromised, they won't get access to any others.
- ‚ùå Do not make up a password yourself. Let Safari do it. It will be a better password.

### Let Safari Remember Your Passwords

- When Safari asks you to save a password, do it!
- ‚ùå Do not keep passwords in a giant word doc or Note, or written down on a piece of paper stuck to your wall. Use the Passwords app.
- ‚ùå Strong passwords are hard to remember, on purpose.

### Let Safari Autofill Your Passwords

- Safari will automatically fill in your saved passwords.
- ‚úÖ You don't need to remember them, or type complex junk. It's automatic.

### Looking up Passwords & Sharing

- You can look up any saved passwords by using the Passwords app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.
- You can share passwords there, but honestly, it's safer not to.

### Turn on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

MFA/2FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. Instead of just using a password, you‚Äôll also need a second step, like a code sent to your phone. This makes it much harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they get access to your password.

Luckily, your Apple devices will automatically use MFA codes from text messages and emails, as well as their built-in Google Authenticator verification codes, so using a second password step is almost completely automated.

- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for important accounts like your email, bank accounts, and social media.
- Use Google Authenticator method if you have a choice, because Apple has it built in, otherwise text messages are the next easiest option.
- Safari will automatically fill in these MFA codes for you so it's almost automatic.
