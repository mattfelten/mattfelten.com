I learned the design process the way most of us did. Research, define, ideate, prototype, test, iterate. It's a good framework. It taught me to slow down, to ask questions before jumping to solutions, to listen to people who aren't me. Process gave me rigor. It strengthened my empathy. It taught me to ask the right questions.

But the cost of trying ideas has dropped dramatically. Better tools, design systems, mature frameworks, AI. When making is cheap, you can explore more, quicker. My process has shifted from _narrow down, then build_ to _build many, then narrow down._

I had a project recently. A third-party integration, fast-paced partnership, needed to ship quickly.

1. Started with team brainstorming. I took those rough notes and shaped them into different possible directions.
2. Built seven working prototypes in two days. Not mockups. Functional React code running in the app. They ranged from the smallest change possible to a full feature redesign.
3. Clicked through each prototype, felt which ones were getting closer, and narrowed down to the strongest. Quick conversations with teammates to build consensus.
4. A half-day of craft, bouncing between Figma and code. The bigger the feature, the faster it is to prototype in code, but specific UI elements are still faster to nail down in Figma. The winning prototype turned into shipped code. Reworked, polished, tested for accessibility and responsiveness.

Concept to production, under a week.

I explored a wide range of ideas deliberately. Small incremental additions slowly degrade a UI without anyone noticing. One more button here, one more panel there. Sometimes the right answer really is the smallest change. Sometimes the whole thing needs rethinking. Sometimes the best solution is somewhere in between. You don't know until you see the full spectrum.

When you can prototype that fast, the bottleneck isn't execution. It's judgment. Knowing which direction to ship. Process tries to make that call less subjective, and sometimes that's helpful. But taken too far, it dismisses everything a designer spends their career developing. Taste, empathy, a feel for quality. You take in the research, the feedback, the data, and then you decide what to act on and what to set aside. That's the work.

My process isn't a diamond diagram. It's a set of values.

- Stay close to the materials. The code, the users, the data.
- Do enough research to unlock making. Keep researching as you go.
- Explore more than necessary.
- Decide with conviction.
