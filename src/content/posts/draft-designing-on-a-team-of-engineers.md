title: Designing on a Team of Engineers
draft: true
description: What it's like being the only designer embedded with nine engineers. How collaboration works when there's no design team to back you up. How "confirm with the team" actually plays out. Where constraint forces better prioritization and judgment. Counterpoint to the "designers are stretched too thin" narrative.
