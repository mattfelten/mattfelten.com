title: The Judgment Gap
draft: true
description: How judgment and taste get built over a career. Not innate talent, but accumulated reps. Mistakes, exposure, feedback, working across different contexts. The difference between taste (knowing what's good) and judgment (knowing what to ship given constraints, politics, timelines). How a decade of management builds a different kind of judgment than IC work.
