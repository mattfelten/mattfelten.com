title: Where Does the Value Live?
date: 2025-02-12

<!-- OUTLINE — not final copy -->

<!--
THESIS: The design industry built its identity around process. But execution just got cheap. When anyone can prototype 7 ideas in 2 days, the value isn't in the process or the artifacts — it's in the judgment to know what to build, the taste to know when it's right, and the willingness to work wherever the highest-leverage work actually is.
-->

<!--
TONE NOTES:
- First person, personal, reflective — like "I'm An Imposter" and "Bring Me Problems"
- Not attacking designers or the industry. Frame as: "we all learned process for good reason, AND the ground is shifting"
- Show, don't tell. Use your own stories as proof, not hypothetical criticism of others.
- Speak from experience, not authority. "Here's what I've found" not "here's what you should do."

## SECTION 1: The Process I Learned
<!-- ~200 words -->

<!--
Open with: I learned the design process the way most of us did. Research, define, ideate, prototype, test, iterate. It's a good framework. It taught me to slow down, to ask questions before jumping to solutions, to listen.

Acknowledge that process IS valuable. It's how junior designers learn empathy and rigor. It's how teams align. Reference your own growth — self-taught, no mentor, process gave you structure when you had none.

But introduce the tension: somewhere along the way, process stopped being a tool and started being the point. The industry got really good at talking about how we work and less good at showing exceptional outcomes.

Reference the Frank Chimero idea (paraphrased) — a designer's superpower is bridging the present into the future, making the exciting thing real. That requires intuition, a point of view, some guts. And those things don't live in a process diagram.

End with: I don't think process is the problem. I think mistaking process for the work is the problem.

## SECTION 2: The Ground Shifted
<!-- ~250 words -->

<!--
Transition: And then execution got cheap.

Describe what changed for you practically — not a think-piece about AI in the abstract, but your lived experience. You started using AI across your workflow: organizing meeting notes, generating user flows, brainstorming solutions, writing frontend code. Not for visual design (you're not comfortable putting your name on generative UI yet), but for everything around it.

The key insight: when the cost of trying an idea drops to nearly zero, you stop trying to pick the "right" idea upfront and start trying more ideas, faster. The process shifts from "narrow down, then build" to "build many, then narrow down."

Use the integration project as the concrete story. Third-party integration, fast-paced partnership, needed to ship ASAP. You created 7 working React prototypes in 2 days. Not mockups — functional code in-app. They ranged across a full spectrum: one redesigned the entire customer dashboard, one was the smallest change possible, others fell in between. You clicked through them, felt which ones were closer to the right outcome, funneled down to a shortlist.

Then a half-day of manual craft — bouncing between Figma and React. Larger layouts and workflows were faster to explore in code. Specific UI elements (card designs, interactions) were faster to iterate in Figma. You made about 7 iterations of a single card component in Figma before landing on the right one. Then connected an AI tool to bring that design into code.

Concept to production. Under a week.

## SECTION 3: Where Judgment Matters More Than Process
<!-- ~300 words -->

<!--
The uncomfortable realization: when you can prototype fast, the bottleneck isn't execution anymore. It's decision-making. And no process can make that decision for you.

This is where you've had to grow. You've had to get better at evaluating, not just creating. Comparing 7 prototypes side by side and knowing which one to ship requires taste — a word designers love to use but rarely define. For you, taste is: Does this feel right for the person using it? Does it solve the real problem, not just the stated one? Is it as simple as it can be?

The spectrum approach: you deliberately prototype across a range, from smallest-viable-change to full-redesign. This is important because of the "boiling frog" problem — small incremental additions slowly degrade a UI without anyone noticing. Sometimes the right answer is the smallest change. Sometimes you realize the whole thing needs rethinking. You don't know until you see both ends of the spectrum side by side.

Address the tension honestly: this doesn't mean process is useless. Research still matters. Understanding users still matters. But the ratio has changed. You spend less time in long discovery phases and more time in rapid build-evaluate-decide loops. The thinking happens through making, not before it.

Mention the failure mode you've seen (without naming names or pointing fingers): when process becomes a substitute for judgment. When every decision requires a user test. When the lag of scheduling interviews and waiting for results means the smallest update takes months. You've seen thoughtful process produce great work. You've also seen process used as a shield — as long as you followed the steps, the outcome doesn't matter. Both are real.

The point isn't "skip research" or "move fast and break things." The point is: process should serve your judgment, not replace it.

## SECTION 4: The Work That Doesn't Look Like Design
<!-- ~250 words -->

<!--
Shift to the bigger picture: if the value isn't in production and it isn't in process, where does it live?

For you, the highest-leverage work often doesn't look like "design work" at all. You scope projects. You define API shapes with backend engineers. You refine tasks for the engineering team. You work with product management on roadmaps — not just "what are we building" but "why are we building it."

When you see a UX papercut, half the time you file a ticket. The other half, you just fix it in code yourself. When the team is under pressure to ship, you pick up engineering tasks.

This isn't about being a unicorn or a "full-stack designer" (a term that probably makes you cringe). It's about going wherever the highest-value work is, regardless of what your title says you should be doing.

Connect this back to the Frank Chimero idea: bridging the present into the future. That bridge isn't built in Figma or in a sprint planning doc. It's built in the space between disciplines — in the conversations about scope, the decisions about what NOT to build, the API contract that shapes the user experience before a single pixel is designed.

Acknowledge that not every team works this way. You've been on teams with hard walls between roles, where being a designer felt like being a roadblock instead of an asset. But when you find a team that values someone working across those lines, the leverage is enormous.

## SECTION 5: Close
<!-- ~150 words -->

<!--
Bring it home. Short, personal.

Your process isn't a diamond diagram or a set of steps. It's a set of values: stay close to the real materials (code, users, data). Try more things than you think you need to. Have the guts to make a call. Go where the work is, not where your title says you should be.

You're still skeptical about AI's long-term effects on design and on how we think. You don't have that figured out. But you'd rather be in the arena figuring it out than in the stands commenting on it.

End on something forward-looking and genuine. Maybe tie back to the Chimero quote or your "incremental correctness" philosophy — you're not claiming to have the final answer. You're charting the next right step.
