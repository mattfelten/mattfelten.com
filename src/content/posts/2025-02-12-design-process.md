title: Where Does the Value Live?

I learned the design process the way most of us did. Research, define, ideate, prototype, test, iterate. It's a good framework. It taught me to slow down, to ask questions before jumping to solutions, to listen to people who aren't me.

I was mostly self-taught. No mentor. No team of senior designers showing me the ropes. Process gave me something to hold onto when I wasn't sure I was doing any of this right. It's how I learned rigor. It's how I learned empathy. I owe a lot to it.

But somewhere along the way, I think the industry started treating process like the destination instead of the road. We got really good at talking about _how_ we work &mdash; the diamond diagrams, the workshops, the ceremony &mdash; and a little less focused on the outcomes themselves.

Frank Chimero has this idea that a designer's superpower is bridging the present into the future. Taking the exciting possibility and making it real. That takes intuition. A point of view. Some guts. Those things don't live in a process diagram.

I don't think process is the problem. I think mistaking process for the work is.

And then execution got faster.

Not just AI &mdash; better design tools, component libraries, mature frontend frameworks, tighter feedback loops across the board. The whole stack of making things got cheaper. AI is part of that, the same way Figma was part of it, the same way Sketch was before that. Tools evolve. The interesting question isn't about which tool. It's what changes when the cost of trying an idea drops to nearly zero.

Here's what changed for me: I stopped trying to pick the "right" idea upfront and started trying more ideas, faster. The process flipped from _narrow down, then build_ to _build many, then narrow down._

I had a project recently &mdash; a third-party integration, fast-paced partnership, needed to ship as soon as possible. I created seven working React prototypes in two days. Not mockups. Functional code, running in the app. They covered a full spectrum: one redesigned the entire customer dashboard, one was the smallest change possible, and the rest fell in between. I clicked through each of them, felt which ones were getting closer, and funneled down to a shortlist.

Then a half-day of craft &mdash; bouncing between Figma and code. Larger layouts and workflows were faster to explore in React. Specific UI elements, like a card component, were faster to iterate in Figma. I went through about seven iterations of that card before it felt right. Then brought the design into code.

Concept to production. Under a week.

When you can prototype that fast, the bottleneck moves. It's not execution anymore. It's decision-making. And no process can make that decision for you.

I've had to get better at evaluating, not just creating. Looking at seven prototypes side by side and knowing which one to ship &mdash; that requires taste. Designers love that word but rarely define it. For me it's pretty simple:

- Does this feel right for the person using it?
- Does it solve the real problem, not just the stated one?
- Is it as simple as it can be?

---

The spectrum approach is deliberate. I prototype across a range, from smallest-viable-change to full-redesign, because of the boiling frog problem. Small incremental additions slowly degrade a UI without anyone noticing. One more button here. One more settings panel there. Eventually the whole thing is a mess and nobody can point to when it happened.

Sometimes the right answer really is the smallest change. Sometimes you realize the whole thing needs rethinking. You don't know until you see both ends side by side.

None of this means process is useless. Research still matters. Understanding users still matters. But the ratio changed for me. I spend less time in long discovery phases and more time in rapid build-evaluate-decide loops. The thinking happens _through_ making, not before it.

I've seen thoughtful process produce great work. I've also seen process become a safety net &mdash; follow the steps, and the outcome feels secondary. I've been guilty of both. The point isn't to skip research or move fast and break things. The point is that process should serve your judgment, not replace it.

Here's the other thing I've been wrestling with. Design work is bigger than most of us define it.

I scope projects. I define API shapes with backend engineers. I refine tasks for the engineering team. I work with product on roadmaps &mdash; not just _what_ are we building but _why_ are we building it.

When I see a UX papercut, half the time I file a ticket. The other half, I just fix it in code. When the team is under pressure to ship, I pick up engineering work.

This isn't about being a unicorn. It's about recognizing that design decisions happen everywhere &mdash; in the API contract, in the scope conversation, in what you decide _not_ to build. If I limit myself to Figma, I'm missing half the places where the user experience actually gets shaped.

---

Not every team works this way. I've been on teams with hard walls between roles, where being a designer felt like being a tollbooth. But when a team values someone working across those lines, the leverage is enormous. That's the bridge Chimero is talking about &mdash; between the present and the future. It gets built in the space between disciplines.

My process isn't a diamond diagram. It's a set of values.

- Stay close to the real materials &mdash; code, users, data.
- Try more things than you think you need to.
- Have the guts to make a call.
- Go where the work is, not where your title says you should be.

I'm not claiming to have this figured out. I'm just trying to take the next right step.
