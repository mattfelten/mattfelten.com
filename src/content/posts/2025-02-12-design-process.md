title: Where Does the Value Live?

<!-- OUTLINE — not final copy -->

<!--
THESIS: The design industry built its identity around process. But execution got faster — better tools, better frameworks, better workflows. When anyone can prototype 7 ideas in 2 days, the value isn't in the process or the artifacts — it's in the judgment to know what to build, the taste to know when it's right, and the willingness to work wherever the highest-leverage work actually is.

<!--
TONE + STRUCTURE NOTES:
- First person, personal, reflective — like "I'm An Imposter" and "Bring Me Problems"
- Not attacking designers or the industry. Frame as: "we all learned process for good reason, AND the ground is shifting"
- Show, don't tell. Use your own stories as proof, not hypothetical criticism of others.
- Speak from experience, not authority. "Here's what I've found" not "here's what you should do."
- Don't force word counts. Be succinct. 3 sentences is fine if it lands.
- Mix formats freely — prose, bullets, line dividers between connected-but-distinct thoughts. Untraditional is good.

## SECTION 1: The Process I Learned

<!--
I learned the design process the way most of us did. Research, define, ideate, prototype, test, iterate. It's a good framework. It taught me to slow down, to ask questions before jumping to solutions, to listen.

Process IS valuable. It's how junior designers learn empathy and rigor. It's how teams align. It gave me structure when I had none — self-taught, no mentor.

But somewhere along the way, process stopped being a tool and started being the point. The industry got really good at talking about how we work and less focused on the outcomes themselves.

Frank Chimero idea (paraphrased) — a designer's superpower is bridging the present into the future, making the exciting thing real. That requires intuition, a point of view, some guts. Those things don't live in a process diagram.

I don't think process is the problem. I think mistaking process for the work is the problem.

## SECTION 2: The Ground Shifted

<!--
And then execution got faster.

Not just AI — better design tools, component libraries, mature frontend frameworks, faster feedback loops across the board. The whole stack of making things got cheaper. AI is part of that, the same way Figma was part of it, the same way Sketch was part of it before that. Tools evolve. The interesting question isn't "which tool" — it's what changes when the cost of trying an idea drops to nearly zero.

What changed for me: I stopped trying to pick the "right" idea upfront and started trying more ideas, faster. The process shifted from "narrow down, then build" to "build many, then narrow down."

The integration project as the concrete story. Third-party integration, fast-paced partnership, needed to ship ASAP. I created 7 working React prototypes in 2 days. Not mockups — functional code in-app. They ranged across a full spectrum: one redesigned the entire customer dashboard, one was the smallest change possible, others fell in between. I clicked through them, felt which ones were closer to the right outcome, funneled down to a shortlist.

Then a half-day of manual craft — bouncing between Figma and React. Larger layouts and workflows were faster to explore in code. Specific UI elements (card designs, interactions) were faster to iterate in Figma. About 7 iterations of a single card component in Figma before landing on the right one.

Concept to production. Under a week.

## SECTION 3: Where Judgment Matters More Than Process

<!--
When you can prototype fast, the bottleneck isn't execution anymore. It's decision-making. No process can make that decision for you.

I've had to get better at evaluating, not just creating. Comparing 7 prototypes side by side and knowing which one to ship requires taste — a word designers love but rarely define. For me it's: Does this feel right for the person using it? Does it solve the real problem, not just the stated one? Is it as simple as it can be?

---

The spectrum approach: I deliberately prototype across a range, from smallest-viable-change to full-redesign. This matters because of the "boiling frog" problem — small incremental additions slowly degrade a UI without anyone noticing. Sometimes the right answer is the smallest change. Sometimes the whole thing needs rethinking. You don't know until you see both ends side by side.

---

This doesn't mean process is useless. Research still matters. Understanding users still matters. But the ratio changed. Less time in long discovery phases, more time in rapid build-evaluate-decide loops. The thinking happens through making, not before it.

I've seen thoughtful process produce great work. I've also seen process used as a shield — follow the steps, and the outcome becomes secondary. Both are real.

Process should serve your judgment, not replace it.

## SECTION 4: Go Where the Work Is

<!--
Reframe: it's not that design work isn't valuable. It's that design work is bigger than most people define it.

I scope projects. I define API shapes with backend engineers. I refine tasks for the engineering team. I work with product on roadmaps — not just "what are we building" but "why."

When I see a UX papercut, half the time I file a ticket. The other half, I fix it in code myself. When the team is under pressure to ship, I pick up engineering tasks.

This isn't about being a unicorn. It's about recognizing that design decisions happen everywhere — in the API contract, in the scope conversation, in what you decide NOT to build. If I limit myself to Figma, I'm missing half the places where the user experience actually gets shaped.

---

Not every team works this way. I've been on teams with hard walls between roles, where being a designer felt like being a roadblock instead of an asset. But when a team values someone working across those lines, the leverage is enormous.

Connect back to Chimero: bridging the present into the future. That bridge gets built in the space between disciplines.

## SECTION 5: Close

<!--
Short, personal.

My process isn't a diamond diagram. It's a set of values:
- Stay close to the real materials — code, users, data.
- Try more things than you think you need to.
- Have the guts to make a call.
- Go where the work is, not where your title says you should be.

End on something forward-looking and genuine. Tie back to "incremental correctness" — not claiming to have the final answer, just charting the next right step.
