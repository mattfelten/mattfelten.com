title: Where Does the Value Live?

I learned the design process the way most of us did. Research, define, ideate, prototype, test, iterate. It's a good framework. It taught me to slow down, to ask questions before jumping to solutions, to listen to people who aren't me.

I didn't come up on big design teams. A lot of what I know came from doing a lot of work, talking with other designers, reading articles on the internet, trying things out and keeping what stuck. Process gave me something to hold onto when I wasn't sure I was doing any of this right. It's how I learned rigor. It's how I learned empathy. I owe a lot to it.

But somewhere along the way, it's easy for process to become the destination instead of the road. I've seen it, I've done it &mdash; getting really good at talking about _how_ we work, the diamond diagrams, the workshops, the ceremony &mdash; and losing focus on the outcomes.

[Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/) wrote in [The Shape of Design](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/) that a designer's superpower is bridging the present into the future. I love that framing. Taking the exciting possibility and making it real &mdash; that takes intuition. A point of view. Some guts. Those things don't live in a process diagram.

I don't think process is the problem. I think mistaking process for the work is.

And then execution got faster.

We got better design tools, component libraries, mature frontend frameworks, tighter feedback loops across the board. AI. The whole stack of making things got cheaper, the same way it did when Figma came along, the same way it did with Sketch before that. Tools evolve. The interesting question isn't about which tool. It's what changes when the cost of trying an idea drops to nearly zero.

Design has always been iterative &mdash; lots of directions, lots of dead ends. What changed is the speed. The whole loop got faster. I went from _narrow down, then build_ to _build many, then narrow down._

I had a project recently &mdash; a third-party integration, fast-paced partnership, needed to ship as soon as possible. I created seven working React prototypes in two days. Not mockups. Functional code, running in the app. They covered a full spectrum: one redesigned the entire customer dashboard, one was the smallest change possible, and the rest fell in between. I clicked through each of them, felt which ones were getting closer, and funneled down to a shortlist.

Then a half-day of craft &mdash; bouncing between Figma and code. I've found that the bigger the feature &mdash; more screens, more steps, more edge cases &mdash; the faster it is to prototype in code. But specific UI elements, like a card component, are still faster to nail down in Figma. I went through about seven iterations of that card before it felt right. Then brought the design into code.

Concept to production. Under a week.

When you can prototype that fast, the bottleneck moves. It's not execution anymore. It's judgment &mdash; the subjectivity, the instinct for what feels right. That's the part no diagram can replace.

I've had to get better at evaluating, not just creating. Looking at seven prototypes side by side and knowing which one to ship &mdash; that requires taste. Designers love that word but rarely define it. For me it's pretty simple:

- Does this feel right for the person using it?
- Does it solve the real problem, not just the stated one?
- Is it as simple as it can be?

There's a reason I prototype across a wide range, from smallest-viable-change to full-redesign. Small incremental additions slowly degrade a UI without anyone noticing. One more button here. One more settings panel there. Eventually the whole thing is a mess and nobody can point to when it happened.

Sometimes the right answer really is the smallest change. Sometimes you realize the whole thing needs rethinking. You don't know until you see both ends side by side.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-process. Research still matters. Understanding users still matters. But I think of process steps as tools in a toolbelt now. Depending on the problem, I pull out what I need to get to a great outcome. I spend less time in long discovery phases and more time in rapid build-evaluate-decide loops. The thinking happens _through_ making, not before it.

I've seen thoughtful process produce great work. I've also seen process become a safety net &mdash; follow the steps, and the outcome feels secondary. I've been guilty of that. The point isn't to skip research or move fast and break things. The point is that process should serve your judgment, not replace it.

Here's the other thing I keep coming back to. Everyone takes part in good user experience, not just designers. How we prioritize projects is design work. How a feature gets implemented in code is design work. It all has an impact on what the user sees at the end, how it feels.

I scope projects. I define API shapes with backend engineers. I refine tasks for the engineering team. I work with product on roadmaps &mdash; not just _what_ are we building but _why_ are we building it.

When I see a UX papercut, half the time I file a ticket. The other half, I just fix it in code. When the team is under pressure to ship, I pick up engineering work.

This isn't about being a unicorn. It's about recognizing that design decisions happen everywhere &mdash; in the API contract, in the scoping conversation, in what you decide _not_ to build. If I limit myself to Figma, I'm missing half the places where the user experience actually gets shaped.

---

Not every team works this way. I've been on teams with hard walls between roles, where design felt like an obligatory step in the product development process. But when a team values someone working across those lines, the leverage is enormous. The best work happens in the space between disciplines.

My process isn't a diamond diagram. It's a set of values.

- Stay close to the materials, the code, the users, the data.
- Explore more than necessary.
- Decide with conviction.
- Follow the work, not the role.

I'm not claiming to have this figured out. I'm just trying to take the next right step.
