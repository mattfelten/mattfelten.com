**What I worked on:**

- Redesigned the 20-year-old control panel, rethinking information architecture and user mental models
- Worked closely with the Creative Director on a company rebrand, then built the new marketing site
- Created internal design system and component library
- Shipped third-party integrations (QNAP cloud storage partnership)

This was my first opportunity to hire and manage designers and frontend developers — a theme that continued through most of my subsequent roles.

## Company Rebrand (2014)

Worked with the Creative Director to refresh DreamHost's brand identity. We ran exercises to define brand values (Authentic, Passionate, Community, Inventive) and personality. I then built the new marketing site using Jekyll for performance and modern tooling.

## Control Panel Refresh (2015)

First phase of a multi-year redesign effort. Focused on the application chrome — header and navigation. Condensed 75 top-level navigation items into 5 main sections through card sorting exercises.

## Control Panel Redesign (2017)

Full reimagining of the 20-year-old control panel. The key insight: users think in terms of websites, not services. Reorganized the entire architecture around that mental model.

Led a team of 3 designers through research, prototyping, and user testing. Delivered a coded Vue.js prototype and design system foundation.

## QNAP Integration (2014)

Turned the cloud storage product into a platform for third-party integrations. The challenge: designing flows that cross between two different company interfaces.
