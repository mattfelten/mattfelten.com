**What I worked on:**

- Redesigned the 20-year-old control panel, rethinking information architecture and user mental models
- Worked closely with the Creative Director on a company rebrand, then built the new marketing site
- Created internal design system and component library
- Shipped third-party integrations (QNAP cloud storage partnership)

This was my first opportunity to hire and manage designers and frontend developers — a theme that continued through most of my subsequent roles.
