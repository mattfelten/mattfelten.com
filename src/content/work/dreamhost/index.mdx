**What I worked on:**

- Redesigned the 20-year-old control panel, rethinking information architecture and user mental models
- Led a company rebrand, then built the new marketing site
- Created internal design systems and component libraries
- Shipped third-party integrations (QNAP cloud storage partnership)

**The shift:** This role is where I became a hybrid designer-engineer. I started in visual design and ended up writing production frontend code. I went from pushing pixels to pushing commits.
